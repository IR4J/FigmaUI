## Description

When I visited California, I took a ride in a Waymo and was intrigued by the UI design. This Inspired me so I set out to recreate it in Figma as accurately as possible once I returned home.

## Design Process

I used a reference image from the Waymo car then imported it into Figma. Then, I searched for "Waymo brand colors" on Google to find the exact colors used. With that set, I began designing. It took some time to get the dimensions right, but I eventually did. For the icons, I used the SF Symbols library on my MacBook.

# 2) Figure Robot Face 

## Description

Using Figma, I made the robot's face. It took time and trial and error to align the boxes and animation correctly but after a while I got it to work.
